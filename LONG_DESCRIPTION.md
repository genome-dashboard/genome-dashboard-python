Genome Dashboard is the logic behind a web-based prototype of a genomics
dashboard, specifically designed to integrate informatics and 4D
material studies of chromatin. Genome Dashboard unites our Interactive
Chromatin Modeling (ICM) tools with the Biodalliance genome browser and
the JSMol molecular viewer to rapidly fold any DNA sequence into atomic
or coarse-grained models of DNA, nucleosomes or chromatin.
